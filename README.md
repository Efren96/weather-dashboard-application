# Weather Dashboard Application

## About Project 

This week we had to make a weather app using html, css, and java script and since this is an odd week we were not given any starter code. The weather app had to have a search bar in order to search for a city. Once you search for the city you were presented with the current weather and the 5 day forcast including weather icons and any city that was searched for had to be saved in the history using local storage.

## Steps I Took To Complete Challenge 

* The first thing i did was create a new repository on GitHub and copy it on to my local machine.

* Then went over the acceptance criteria to make a checklist of the things that needed to be done.

* Then i started bulding the weather app with html creating the basic structure like adding the heading title, search input/buttons and creating cards for where all the weather data will be stored.

* After i had the basic html layout completed i made a css file in order to style it to my liking, adding unique font, background colors and spacing to give it a polished and user friendly look.

* Once i was done with the styling i created the java script file to start adding functionality to the app.
